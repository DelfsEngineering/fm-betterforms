# Actions Processor

An action is an instruction that tells the BetterForms framework to perform some operation. The actions processor allows you to create interactions with the user. The actions object can be an array of actions. Actions are executed sequentially. Some actions block the executing of the next action until they are complete.

The actions processor is basically a scripting language processor. Nearly all aspects of the BF app can be controlled with actions.
