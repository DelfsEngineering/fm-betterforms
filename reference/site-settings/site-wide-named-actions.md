# Site-wide Named Actions

Site-wide named actions can be defined in the **Environment > Named Actions** tab in your [site settings](./). When a named action is called, BetterForms will first look to see if a page-specific named action is defined, then check for a site-wide named action.

For more detail about named actions, see this page:

{% content-ref url="../actions-processor/actions_named.md" %}

{% endcontent-ref %}
