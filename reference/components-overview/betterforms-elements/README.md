# BetterForms Elements

This section provides an overview of the standard page elements available in BetterForms for building dynamic and interactive forms. These elements are foundational building blocks derived from a robust, schema-based form generation library that powers many of BetterForms' core input capabilities.

For each element, you'll find a brief description of its use within the BetterForms environment and a list of common configuration properties. For a comprehensive list of all available properties, advanced configuration options, and the full technical specification, please refer to the original library documentation for that specific element, which will be linked on its respective page.

Our aim is to provide you with the essential information to get started with these elements in BetterForms, while also guiding you to the exhaustive resources for more in-depth exploration.
