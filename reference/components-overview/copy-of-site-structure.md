# Copy of Site Structure

## App Sections

There are two main sections of your app. The **Site** section which is global to the whole app and the **Page** section which is scoped to a particular page.&#x20;

### Site Structure

The site structure consists of main parts.

* **Header** - This is the top section of the app. The header contains several slots
* **Navigation** - This navigation consists of the leftmost sidebar
* **Page** - This is the main working area you will use to build your app's page content. Note the page section technically extends up behind the&#x20;
