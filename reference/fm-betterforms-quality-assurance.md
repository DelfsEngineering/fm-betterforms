# FM BetterForms - Quality Assurance

At Delfs' Engineering, we take pride in our quality control process, which is an integral part of our commitment to delivering exceptional products and services to our clients.

Our QA process is structured to ensure a high level of quality at every stage of project development. Here's an overview of how our QA process works:

**Initial Assessment:** Our team closely collaborates with the client, and the QA process begins with an initial assessment of project requirements, objectives, and client expectations.

**Test Planning:** Once project requirements are defined, our QA specialist creates a comprehensive test plan. This plan outlines the scope of testing, test cases, testing environments, and timelines.

**Testing Execution:** Our QA department conducts various types of testing, including functional, performance, security, and usability testing. Each test is designed to identify and resolve potential issues, ensuring the product meets quality standards.

**Bug Tracking:** Throughout the testing phase, any identified issues are meticulously tracked and documented. Our team categorizes and prioritizes these issues for resolution.

**Regression Testing:** Whenever code changes are made, we conduct regression testing to verify that existing functionalities remain intact and unaffected by updates.

**Client Collaboration:** We maintain open communication with our clients, providing regular updates on testing progress, issue resolution, and results. Client feedback is invaluable for refining our processes.

**Final Verification:** Before product deployment, we perform a final verification to ensure all quality standards have been met. This includes testing on various devices, browsers, and platforms to guarantee compatibility.

**Documentation:** Testing results and any issues encountered during testing are thoroughly documented.

**Post-Deployment Support:** Our commitment to quality extends beyond deployment. We provide post-deployment support to address any unforeseen issues and ensure a smooth user experience.

_At Delfs' Engineering, we believe that the QA process is a fundamental element in building trust and maintaining long-term partnerships with our clients._
