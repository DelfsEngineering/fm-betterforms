# Software Testing Overview

## **Types of Testing**

#### Manual Testing

Human execution of test procedures without using test automation tools or programming languages.

#### Test Automation

A process of writing and executing a computer program to do testing.

#### Black Box testing

Testing done from user perspective (no access to source code used).

#### Gray Box Testing

Gray box testing is using structural, design, and/or environment information to expand or focus Black box testing and to enhance testing productivity by using appropriate methods and tools.

#### White box Testing

White box testing is done at the source code level. This testing is based on knowledge of the internal logic of an applications code.

#### Functional Testing

Functional testing is conducted to verify that functions of a system are working as specified. Typically functions are described in work products (requirements, specifications, etc.), but can be undocumented;

#### Non-Functional Testing

Non-Functional testing is conducted to test attributes of a component or system that do not relate to functionality: Reliability; Efficiency; Usability; Maintainability; Compatibility, etc.

#### Positive Testing

Aimed at showing that software handles properly situations in which user acts as expected (verification).

#### Negative Testing

Aimed at showing that software handles properly situations in which user acts not as user is supposed to act (invalid actions, inputs, settings.)

#### Boundary Testing

Boundary testing or a Boundary value analysis explores values near the limits of valid ranges. 100 < x < 200

#### Exploratory Testing

Exploratory testing is when the tester "explores" an application. No requirements. Tester, based on experience and creativity, learns things and generates new tests to run. Black box testing. Manual testing.

#### Ad hoc testing

Simplified form of Exploratory Testing where Planning, Executing and Learning are happening at the same time.

#### Unit Testing

White box testing of software components/modules. Executed by developers or whitebox testers.

#### Integration Testing

Integration testing is a phase in software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group.

#### System Testing

System testing is conducted on COMPLETE SYSTEM to evaluate it's compliance with the requirements. System testing is a black box testing.

#### End-to-end Testing

Test a complete application in closest to production environment (interacting with a database using network communications or interacting with other hardware applications or systems if appropriate, etc.).

#### User Acceptance Testing

UAT is the very last test executed by SMEs (subject matter experts) on behalf of the future users.

#### Release/Build Acceptance Testing

Test done on newly compiled build/release to make sure it's good enough to be accepted for testing, so the QA team can move from previous release to the new one.

#### Installation Testing

Installation testing verifies that the system is installed and set up correctly to work ia a specified software/hardware environment.

#### Compatibility Testing

Conducted on the application to evaluate its compatibility with the different OS, Hardware, Browsers, etc.

#### Browser Compatibility Testing

Making sure that web application looks, behaves, and responds the same way across different browsers.

#### Smoke Testing

Same as build acceptance testing. Superficial testing of main features to decide if the build is good enough to be send to QA.

#### Regression Testing

Partial retesting of a modified program to make sure that no new errors were introduced while making changes to the code (developing new or fixing existing one).

#### Alpha Testing

Alpha testing takes place at developers' site. Making sure the application has the right look and feel. Functionality is not expected to be fully in place.

#### Beta Testing

Beta testing takes place at customers' sites, and involves testing by a group of customers who use the system at their own locations and provide feedback, before the system is released to other customers.

#### Performance Testing

Determining how the system performs in terms of responsiveness and stability under a PARTICULAR workload.

#### Load Testing

Load testing is conducted to understand the behavior of the system under a specific expected load. Simplest form of performance testing.

#### Stress Testing

Stress testing is conducted to understand the behavior of the system under an extreme load.

#### Recoverability Testing

Recoverability testing is conducted to verify that if the system fails: How it will re-establish a specified level of performance? How it will recover directly affected data?

#### Usability Testing

Usability testing is used to evaluate product by testing it on users. Usability testing measures how easy it is to use specific object or set of objects.

#### Accessibility Testing

Accessibility testing is conducted to test the compliance with standards. Examples: World Web Consortium (W3C) - GUI; Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; Wikipedia Accessibility; etc.

#### Security Testing

Security testing is conducted to test that: System data is protected; How system prevents the intrusion by hackers.

#### Localization Testing

Localization is the process of adapting internationalized software for a specific region or language by adding locale-specific components and translating text.

### **Flows**

Flows are the experiences that happen across multiple actions.

Each checklist below gets you to consider the different states and scenarios when you take a user from A to B.

#### **Submitting a form 📨**

A form can help a user achieve anything from creating an account to subscribing to a newsletter. They are often the last step of a user's journey, so should be quick and easy to complete.

**Steps:**

*   [ ] Show button to submit

    Below the form fields, a button to submit the information needs to be present.

    You can change the copy to fit the form e.g. the button can say “Subscribe” if someone is providing their email address to receive emails.
*   [ ] Show loading state after submission

    The user must see the form is in the process of being submitted.

    Note: also make sure your hover state is considered before they press the button!
*   [ ] Show success message when it submits

    The form was submitted! Let’s communicate that back to the user with a clear success message.
*   [ ] If it doesn't, show an error message

    Sometimes, things don’t work out. If the form can’t submit, because of invalid information or another error, that also needs to be shown.
*   [ ] An error may occur because of the wrong information

    If the criteria for a text field isn’t met, the form can fail to submit due to that error, and must be detailed.

#### **Making a payment 💳**

When paying for something online, two thoughts will come to mind for the user: is this safe, and is this clear? A well-designed payment experience covers these by communicating what's happening with a user's money, and that it's all happening securely.

*   [ ] Offer payment methods

    Credit card is the most popular method and can be considered the default.

    Other methods are welcome, but their success sits on a spectrum. Some can add friction for users, while others can add security and/or convenience.
*   [ ] Request card details

    Show all relevant text fields to complete. Consider the size of these fields relative to the details entered.

    Note: in a product where the user is revisiting and saved payment methods are available, consider a flow that allows the user to add/remove payment methods.
*   [ ] Submit payment with card details entered

    It's also important to consider validation before a user submits their details.

    Numbers can be mistyped, the card may have expired - so make sure these numerous error states are addressed.
*   [ ] Show payment processing

    A payment may not be triggered instantly, taking a few seconds (or minutes). A loading page is crucial to calm the user’s nerves in regards to what’s happening to their money.
*   [ ] Confirmation payment processed successfully

    It’s a success! Clearly indicate to the user that their payment was processed, and the funds was received.
*   [ ] Outline next steps

    What now? Does the payment trigger something? If so, let the user know.

    Example 1: a physical product has been purchased. Once the payment has processed, tell the user the order is in motion.

    Example 2: a user signed up for a subscription. Offer a link to continue to the product to start using it.

#### **Contacting support 🆘**

If there's ever a problem, a user should know how to get help. Then when they try to get that help, they should know exactly what kind of communication they're receiving.

*   [ ] Show a link to contact support

    This can be placed in a number of areas, such as:

    * footer in a website
    * settings in a mobile app
    * a page experiencing an error

    Use clear copy and easy to recognize visuals to highlight the link.
*   [ ] Show methods of contact

    If you have one option, showcase it! If you have multiple options (chat, call, FAQ), list them out and represent each of their benefits.

    Chat is great for a specific, complicated issue that needs an instant response. On the other hand, FAQ is great for standard questions that are easy to explain.
*   [ ] Represent how to communicate and what is expected

    Once a method is chosen, make it clear on how the method will work.

    Illustrate the response time, and what the user will need to provide to receive support.

#### **Deleting account 🗑**

Sometimes, it's just not meant to be - and that's okay. Users come and go, so it's important to recognize your solution is only for some and not for all.

For those who want to leave, make it as simple as possible. You can try to understand why they're leaving, but don't get too in the way.

*   [ ] Show a link to delete account

    Don't make this difficult.

    This link should be visible in the profile or settings of a product. It should also be available in the support area.
*   [ ] Politely ask for feedback

    It helps to know why somebody is choosing to leave. But, it should not be pressured or forcefully asked.

    Convey the request feedback to improve other people's experience and to also consider their personal reasons.
*   [ ] Explain what it means to delete the account before confirming

    Be clear with what happens to the account and the information in it should a user close.

    Is all the data permanently deleted? Can they come back and restore their account? Is the deletion immediate, or can they use their account until a certain date?
*   [ ] Confirm account has been deleted

    Now that their account is deleted and it's finally complete, embrace that! Be comfortable acknowledging they have left. Do not show any passive aggressiveness.

#### **Tracking progress 📈**

Progress trackers are determinate indicators to represent where a user is in a journey. They inform the user what they have completed, where they are currently, and what's left to complete.

*   [ ] Determine your type of progress tracker

    This tracker can be visible in many ways — a loading bar, a pie chart, numbered steps.

    An experience with large sections would utilise numbered steps, or "milestones". One overall journey that has incremental steps would utilise a loading bar or pie chart better, perhaps with an overall percentage.
*   [ ] Create your states

    A progress tracker with milestones needs to show 3 states:

    * What's been completed
    * What's currently being completed
    * What hasn't been completed yet
*   [ ] Assemble your tracker

    Final touches can include grouping your sections by milestone, and deciding how you want to label each milestone (by number or by title).

#### **Resetting password 🤫**

Every now and then, a user can't remember their password to log back in. Luckily, it's a straightforward process to change it.

It's important to make the experience feel straightforward, so the user feels like they've gotten back into their account as smooth as possible.

*   [ ] Place reset link close to password field

    Style it as a link to show it is clickable
*   [ ] Ask for account details to verify

    In this case it's usually the email address that's requested, because it can recognise your account and be the channel the link is securely sent to.
*   [ ] Show information has been sent

    Based on the account information provided in Step 2, explain how they can continue.

    If an email was provided, send an email for the next step. If a mobile number was provided, send a code or link to open.
*   [ ] The message sent explains next steps

    This could be a link to a page that allows the user to reset their password.

    It could also be a code for the user to provide on a page to verify their account, to then reset their password.
*   [ ] Reset the password!

    Whether it's a verification code or a link to click behind an email address, the next page should be a clear text field to enter a new password.
*   [ ] Password successfully reset

    After the password has been reset, indicate the successful and push their momentum to their initial intent: logging in.

#### **Showing input error 🚨**

Users mistype all the time - whether it's a finger slipping or rushing through letters, errors happen. So for an everyday occurrence, solving an error should be obvious and seamless.

*   [ ] Keep the input in default state

    The text field should be checked for errors only after the information has been entered.
*   [ ] Allow user to enter information

    Let the user type without interruptions and submit the information aka don't assess as changes are made.
*   [ ] Signal error after loss of focus

    After the input has lost focus (user has clicked another element), the field should be assessed. Looks like we have an error here!

    In this case, explain why the error happened, and what is required to resolve it. For accessibility, combine the text with a visual icon that indicates an error was found.
*   [ ] Return to default state upon reattempt

    Once the user focuses on the field again, the error message should disappear. If there is an error again, the process will simply repeat until they are able to continue.

#### **Entering a promo code 🏷️**

A reward for a user to earn a discount on their purchase, promo codes are a pre-requisite in any e-commerce website.

‍To avoid a confused customer, make sure they understand what is happening with their code - whether it works, expired or isn't applicable.

*   [ ] Make promo code input field visible

    The cart or checkout are pages expected to have a promo code field. It should be in a place that can be seen when scanning towards the button to continue.
*   [ ] Promo code applied successfully

    The change can be reflected using your success state colors (likely green) to indicate the code was applied.

    In the example is two different options, divided by how much information you want to show. For both, hiding the input field altogether makes it clear only one code can be entered.
*   [ ] Reflect promo code effects

    This can be shown with the promo code entry as a total amount, or be represented on In item-to-item basis.

    It's important to also show or at least repeat the discount near the total at checkout.
*   [ ] Promo code error

    The promo code may not be applicable, or entered incorrectly.
*   [ ] Remove promo code

    In some cases, a user might not like the discount offered and prefer the original sale price of an item. Or, they found a better promo code to use.

#### **Saving changes 💾**

Users are constantly updating their details. They might be changing an email address, fixing a typo in their name, or updating their payment details. That's why it's important to confirm that a change has been saved, in the clearest way.

*   [ ] Show the action to save changes

    An action should be visible as a source of confirming changes to be saved - this is usually a button.

    Initially, the action can be disabled. It indicates no changes have been made, and there is nothing to save.

    A common location for this action is in the navigation above the fold, so it's always visible over the content. Another option is after all the content that's editable.
*   [ ] State changes to active once a change is made

    In the example, we've changed the email address, which means a change is waiting to be saved. Changing the state to active brings the action to the user's attention.
*   [ ] Action changes to loading state when pressed

    Once the user

    Now that the changes are being saved, you want to show that action is in progress.

    You can do so with a loading spinner in the action, as the user's view will be on that element.
*   [ ] Notify changes have been saved

    The page will reload or update, and this is the critical part. The user should now be informed that their changes have been saved.

    They can now safely leave the page, knowing the details are locked in until they choose to change them again.

#### **Canceling subscription 🛑**

Similar to closing an account, a user can decide to end their experience and stop paying for your product. Just because they're leaving doesn't mean we can't give them a graceful exit. It's important to make a cancellation obvious to find and easy to travel through.

*   [ ] Show a link in account details

    This doesn't have to be the first or most prominent link, but it should be clearly visible. If you're unsure about including it on the account page, it's suitable to place on the billing settings.
*   [ ] Confirm intent to cancel

    Sometimes, a user miskicks. So it's okay to ask if they're sure they want to make this choice, and not just automatically canceling their subscription.
*   [ ] Request a reason for canceling (optional)

    It can be helpful to receive feedback on why a user is canceling. Too expensive? Competitor preferred? Just don't need it anymore?

    It's an easy way to start identifying the key factors affecting churn.
*   [ ] Confirm subscription has been cancelled

    Now that it's canceled, make sure you tell the user when their subscription is active until.

### **Topics**

Topics affect design on a global scale, in the context of a website or app.

#### **Responsiveness 🎚**

Users access products in all sorts of ways in all sorts of sizes that need to be catered for. Someone should be able to visit a page on a desktop monitor or mobile, and have an experience as similar as it can be.

This checklist ensures you're designing responsively responsibly.

*   [ ] Fluid layout

    Your content must be visible and accessible on any device size
*   [ ] Breakpoints

    Identify when to change your structure and how it will look
*   [ ] Typography

    The size of your text on each device size
*   [ ] Change in selection area

    The area for a user to select an element e.g. text field or button
*   [ ] Scalability

    Minimizing content and adding to it at the right screen size
*   [ ] Vector files for images

    An SVG allows any visual to be at 100% resolution at any size. One file fits all device sizes in being perfect in quality.

#### **Typography 🔤**

Text dictates several characteristics: tone, style, focus and structure. How you execute your typography is just as critical as your color palette, illustrations and overall design of the product.

*   [ ] Font pairings

    How well your font choices work well together
*   [ ] Line alignment and length

    The direction your text sits and how long it runs for
*   [ ] Scale and variation

    How each text style differs in size
*   [ ] Contrast and style

    Visibility and look of text
*   [ ] Spacing

    The distance between your types of text
*   [ ] Switch to light mode

    Some products may be just one or the other, but if you offer both then allow the user to make a seamless switch between the two

#### **Dark mode 🌑**

For a designer, dark mode is larger than just flicking a switch and inverting some colors. The accessibility options completely change and your shades for structure and layout need to be re-evaluated - just for starters.

*   [ ] Adaptable color palette

    What your product looks like visually with a dark setting

    ⭐️ A grey for your darkest color is more flexible in shadows and contrast than black

    ⭐️ The lower the saturation, the more accessible a color will be

    ⭐️ Ensure dark palette for backgrounds must allow white to be accessible
*   [ ] Brand integrity

    Maintain your visual tone and style

    ⭐️ Invert monotone visuals

    ⭐️ Incorporate colours from your brand that are also present in light mode
*   [ ] Elevation

    A way to structure elements to establish heirarchy

    ⭐️ Use lightness over shadows to give focus to certain containers or elements
*   [ ] Switch to light mode

    Some products may be just one or the other, but if you offer both then allow the user to make a seamless switch between the two.

#### **Accessibility 🚹**

The balance between what looks good and what looks accessible is ongoing in products. Sure, some text next to that button will take away its minimalism, but I can guarantee a lot more users will understand what it does more clearly.

Focusing on accessibility increases the opportunities for people to use your product, because it works for them specifically. And with enough effort, 'them' can be anyone.

*   [ ] Hierarchy

    Structuring elements to represent intended flow of information

    ⭐️ Sizing can help establish the importance of information

    ⭐️ Information should start from relevance and influence and descend from there
*   [ ] Written and visual information

    The combination of text and icons to communicate

    ⭐️ Consider whether a visual item can communicate its action without colour and/or text
*   [ ] Colors

    How they inform decisions and contrast with each other

    ⭐️ Always check contrast accessibility, even if it looks good to you
*   [ ] Meta descriptions

    Text description of what an image looks like

    ⭐️ Implement this for when images don't load, or on hover if it does load
*   [ ] Interactions

    How elements change when hovered, clicked, or highlighted on

    ⭐️ A visual change (darker colour, shadow) is one way to show an interaction in motion
*   [ ] Device accessibility

    The difference in size and structure of elements between device sizes

#### **Colors 🎨**

Colors represent your story in a product's interface. They inform the mind emotionally and intellectually on what's happening, and what decision to make next. In short, color is all about influence.

The color of a button influences how a user reacts to its intent. The color of a brand influences a user's choice to commit. The contrast, depth and saturation of color all influence how an element is communicated. A good experience lets color effectively influence.

*   [ ] Color psychology

    How color can impact how people think, feel, and act

    ⭐️ Utilise the psychology e.g. destructive button is red, approved message is green

    ⭐️ Research the cultural differences in color, dependent on who your audience is

    ⭐️ Don't add colors just for appearance, they will always communicate something to the user
*   [ ] Branding values

    How your brand colors incorporate into the experience

    ⭐️ Primary, secondary and tertiary brand colors can translate the hierarchy of actions

    ⭐️ Color can represent your brand's style: traditional or modern, fancy or grungy
*   [ ] UI states

    Showing success, error and warning elements through color

    ⭐️ Don't rely on color only to convey state, combine it with information e.g. explain there is an error when an element's color changes to red
*   [ ] Contrast

    How colors combine in a purposefully different way

    ⭐️ Change your design to grayscale to test contrast from hue and value intensity
*   [ ] Combinations

    How colors work together as a palette

#### **UX Writing ✏️**

UX writing is not copywriting. It's not writing ads, marketing copy or what goes on the merch.

UX writing is interface copy. It's text that explains what features do, and tells a user what action will occur by interacting with that element.

*   [ ] Clear and concise

    Say exactly what will happen, in as few words as possible

    ⭐️ Read your copy back and remove redundant words

    ⭐️ Don't invent new words for actions, keep it familiar
*   [ ] Useful

    Take the user to an intentional direction

    ⭐️ A user should understand what an action is going to do before they interact with it

    ⭐️ Remove jargon that doesn't help the user
*   [ ] Tone

    How your brand comes across through messaging

    ⭐️ Avoid humour, particularly sarcasm as a tone in general as you leave room for interpretation
*   [ ] Consistency

    Wrap a certain action under one word e.g. don't interchange 'Next' and 'Continue' when moving screen to screen

    ⭐️ Consistency helps users notice a purposeful change in copy e.g. a number of 'Next' steps followed by a final 'Confirm' step tells them something different will happen next
*   [ ] Avoid dark patterns

    This isn't your chance to be sarcastic or antagonise the user

    ⭐️If you have a preferred action for the user, change visual hierarchy - don't make the secondary option intentionally sound worse

    ⭐️ Don't hide relevant information or actions from the user out of concern it leads to churn

### **Brand**

Outlining how your brand is executed goes far beyond naming the gradients and diagramming all the circles in your logo. There's storytelling, positioning and assembling what represents your product and the people behind it.

#### **Logo 💠**

Your logo identifies your business. It conveys the product, story and tone all in one. When you've created your logo, it's important to ensure its usability across all platforms and experiences.

*   [ ] Color variations

    What colors (and grayscales) your logo can appear in

    ⭐️ Consider variations on light, dark and colored backgrounds for contrast
*   [ ] Usage

    The do's and don'ts of how and where the logo can be applied e.g. on different platforms, clear space, variations

    ⭐️ Show visual examples of your logo usage

    ⭐️ Consider when the symbol is used versus the wordmark (or both combined!)
*   [ ] Responsiveness

    The flexibility of the logo detail at varying sizes
*   [ ] Guidelines

    Documentation outlining all of the above to cement the principles

#### **Social Media 🔉**

Social media is a critical part of a company's online presence. So, it's important that the content shared throughout these platforms is consistently on brand.

*   [ ] Username

    A unique identifier on a platform

    ⭐️ Be consistent to be found more easily across different social media platforms
*   [ ] Avatar

    A profile picture for each social media platform

    ⭐️ Be consistent to stay recognizable across all platforms
*   [ ] Colors

    Links and actions whose color can be customized

    ⭐️ Primary color is best to go with, unless it is inaccessible then choose alternative
*   [ ] Tone of voice

    The character in your posts and messages on social media
*   [ ] Post guidelines

    The do's and don'ts of what content you can post
*   [ ] Image guidelines

    A background or cover image that typically sits on the profile
*   [ ] Type of content

    Memes, user-generated, professional or behind the scenes

#### **Typography 🔠**

The majority of a user's interface is text, so it tends to make quite an impression. Whether it's expressive or informative, its intention should be to accurately represent the brand.

*   [ ] Weight

    Whether the typeface/s are thin, regular, medium, bold or black
*   [ ] Leading / line spacing

    The amount of vertical spacing between two lines of text
*   [ ] Kerning / letter spacing

    The horizontal spacing between letters in text
*   [ ] Letter case

    Whether the typeface is uppercase, lowercase, sentence case

    ⭐️ Consider where the text is applied and how the letter case appears in each instance
*   [ ] Hierarchy

    The organization of typefaces to structure information
*   [ ] Usage

    The do's and don'ts of how type is used e.g. what restrictions must apply, when to use which type where

    ⭐️ Visual examples of do's and don'ts help convey them clearer
*   [ ] Pairings

    Related to hierarchy, and how your fonts combine and interact with each other
*   [ ] Guidelines

    Documentation outlining all of the above to cement the principles
