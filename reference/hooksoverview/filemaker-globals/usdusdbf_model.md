# $$BF\_Model

This global variable contains the data model for the user's current page. You can read data from it or write data back into it using FileMaker's built-in JSON functions.

By default, the entire contents of the **$$BF\_Model** variable is sent back to the client and overwrites their data when the hook returns. To modify this behavior, see the **$$BF\_State** page.

{% page-ref page="usdusdbf\_state.md" %}
