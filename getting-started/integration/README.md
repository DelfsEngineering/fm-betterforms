# Integration

## Installation Overview

FM BetterForms is a cloud based SAAS platform and requires minimal installation. There is a small FileMaker file `BetterForms_Helper` that is used for assisting developers. This file resides on your FileMaker server.

## Requirements <a id="requirements"></a>

* V16+ FileMaker Server with CWP and XML enabled, V17+ \(preferred\) for data API Support and auto routing scripts using Perform Script by Name.
* CPU powerful enough to handle all script requests, typically your existing FMS box is more than adequate. 
* Fast connection to your FMS box, data-center recommended.
* Base Elements Plugin _\(for integration only\)_

If you meet all of these requirements, you may proceed with the Integration!
