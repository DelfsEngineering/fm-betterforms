# Integration

## Installation Overview

FM BetterForms is a cloud based PaaS (platform as a Service) and requires minimal installation. There is a small FileMaker file **`BetterForms_Helper`** that is used for assisting developers. This file resides on your FileMaker server.

## Requirements <a href="#requirements" id="requirements"></a>

* V20+ FileMaker Server with CWP and XML enabled, V20+ (preferred) for data API Support and auto-routing scripts using Perform Script by Name.
* CPU powerful enough to handle all script requests, typically your existing FMS box is more than adequate.
* Fast connection to your FMS box, data-center hosted files are recommended.
* Base Elements Plugin _(for integration only)_

If you meet all of these requirements, you may proceed with the Integration!
