# 2. Add your Server to BetterForms

In the [BetterForms IDE](https://app.fmbetterforms.com/#/servers), select the Servers tab and follow the instructions to add your FileMaker server.

All that's needed here is the IP address or domain name of your FileMaker server \(credentials are entered later\). Enter a friendly name to be referenced throughout the BetterForms interface.

Once your server is created, click the **Test Connection** button to ensure that the XML gateway is properly enabled on your server.

## Troubleshooting this step

For FileMaker Server 17, the XML gateway must be enabled from the command line. See [this guide](http://docs.360works.com/index.php/Enable_XML_FileMaker_17) for instructions on that configuration.

If you have strict firewall settings protecting your FileMaker server, see [this page](../../security/security.md).
