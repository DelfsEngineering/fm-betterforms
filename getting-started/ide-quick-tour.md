# Getting Familiar with the IDE

After successfully logging in, let's get familiar with the workspace. Below is a screenshot of the main Integrated Development Environment (IDE):

1. **Logo Button**: Located at the top-left corner, this button brings you back to the homepage from any section of the app.
2. **Apps**: This tab allows you to access and manage the different applications you have built or are working on. Here, you can open, edit, or create new apps.
3. **Servers**: In the Servers tab, you can add, delete, and manage server connections and information. This is where you configure the servers your applications will interact with.
4. **File Assets**: This section provides access to all your uploaded files and assets. You can upload new files, organize them, and link them to your apps as needed.
5. **Account**: The Account tab contains your personal and account settings. Here, you can update your profile information, change your password, and manage your subscription. The screenshot below shows an example of the Account tab:

   * **Users**: In this section, you can add or remove users and change their roles within the account.

6.  **Help**: If you need assistance, a Help tab offers various support resources, including documentation, examples & demos, and contact options for technical support.
7. **Report a Bug Button**: Located at the bottom-center, this button allows you to report any issues or bugs you encounter while using the app. Your feedback helps us improve the system.

To start building your first app, click on the [<mark style="color:red;">`"Build your first app"`</mark>](first-app/README.md) button located in the Quick Access section.
