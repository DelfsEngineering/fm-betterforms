# 2.10 Working with Data Tables (Coming Soon)

> **Note: This documentation is currently under development. The content will be expanded to include comprehensive guidance on working with data tables in BetterForms.**

## Overview

Data tables are a powerful feature in BetterForms that allow you to display and interact with tabular data. While [list views](creating-your-first-list-view.md) are great for simple multi-row forms, data tables provide advanced features for displaying and managing complex data sets.

This documentation will cover:

* Creating and configuring data tables
* Implementing sorting and filtering
* Adding pagination
* Customizing table appearance
* Handling table events and interactions
* Best practices for data table implementation

## Common Use Cases

Data tables are ideal for:

1. **Data Management Interfaces**
   * User management systems
   * Product catalogs
   * Order management
   * Inventory tracking
2. **Reporting and Analytics**
   * Sales reports
   * Performance metrics
   * Audit logs
   * Financial statements
3. **Complex Data Display**
   * Multi-column sorting
   * Advanced filtering
   * Pagination of large datasets
   * Custom column formatting
4. **Interactive Data Views**
   * Row selection
   * Inline editing
   * Row expansion for details
   * Custom actions per row

## Prerequisites

Before diving into data tables, you should be familiar with:

* [Creating Your First List View](creating-your-first-list-view.md) for basic multi-row data handling
* Basic understanding of [Vue-Tables-2](https://matanya.gitbook.io/vue-tables-2/options-api#options), as BetterForms data tables are built on this library

## Coming Soon

This section is being actively developed and will be updated with detailed documentation soon. In the meantime, you can refer to the [Data Table component reference](../../../reference/components-overview/common/tables2.md) for basic implementation details.

## Next Steps

Once this documentation is complete, it will provide a comprehensive guide to working with data tables in BetterForms. For now, please refer to:

* The [Data Table component reference](../../../reference/components-overview/common/tables2.md) for basic implementation details
* The [Vue-Tables-2 documentation](https://matanya.gitbook.io/vue-tables-2/options-api#options) for advanced features and options
