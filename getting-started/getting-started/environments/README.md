# Environments

After building your app, you will be taken to the environment management page. Here, you can manage different environments for your app, such as Development, Staging, and Production. This allows you to build,  test and deploy your app in a controlled manner.

**Development Environment**

* This is where you will develop and test new features and changes before moving them to staging or production.
* As shown in the image, the development environment URL is <mark style="color:red;">linxue.fmbetterforms.com</mark>.

**Staging Environment**

* This environment is used for final testing before deployment to production. It mimics the production environment to ensure everything works as expected.
* Click the <mark style="color:red;">`"+ New"`</mark> button under the Staging section to create a staging environment.

**Production Environment**

* This is the live environment where your end users interact with your app. It should only contain thoroughly tested and stable versions of your app.
