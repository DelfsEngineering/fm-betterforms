*   **Edit**: Modify the environment settings, such as its name, stage, domains, and credentials. You can lock the environment to prevent changes (usually for the production environment) and turn on the development tools (usually for the development environment).

    * **Lock Environment**: Prevent any changes to this environment by locking it.
    * **Development Tools**: Enable this option to view development tools such as app and model data on the site page.
