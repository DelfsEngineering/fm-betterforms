# Pages

In the **Pages** tab, you'll see a list of your app's pages. Here, you can:

* **Create a new page**
* **Edit an existing page** from the list
* **Duplicate a page** using the ellipsis dropdown menu on the right side of each page row. This dropdown also includes options to **Preview** and **Delete** a page for your convenience.
