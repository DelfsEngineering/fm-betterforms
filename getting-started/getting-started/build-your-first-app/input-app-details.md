* **App Name**: This is the name that will be displayed in the BetterForms editor and on your dashboard.
* **Public Name**: This is the name that will be displayed on your site. Keep it short; you can change it later.
* **Domain Name**: Enter the subdomain name for your app. You can set up a custom domain later when your app is ready for production. The system will search for available domains as you type.

To be able to have a domain, you need to create a new server or add an existing server. Click on "Create new server" to add a server.

* **Server Name**: Enter a name for your server.
* **Host Address**: Provide the IP or domain name of your server.
* **Gateway**: Select the gateway type (XML or DAPI):
  * **XML Gateway**: Uses XML format for data exchange, typically associated with SOAP web services.
  * **DAPI Gateway**: Uses RESTful web services with JSON format, more efficient and modern.

Click "Create Connection" to add the server.

Once you have filled in all the fields, click the <mark style="color:red;">`"Build app"`</mark> button to proceed.
