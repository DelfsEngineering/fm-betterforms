**ðŸ“˜ Reference**

### **Site Settings - Hassan**

- **Navigation**
- there is no Appearance > Navigation tab
- this section seems to be talking about the Menu Schema not the actual navigation section
- **Site structure**
- Should this be linked on slots page for clarity?
- **Slots / Code Injection**
- window.formGen and formGen.formSchema.model is wrong paths? We dont use formGen
- No "Appearance > Slots" tab we have no appearance section
- headerMiddle and headerRight are not filled in

### **Page Settings - Hassan**

- **Data Model**
- Naming may be confusing as nothing is called "Production data"

**Page Elements - Linxue**

**BetterForms Elements**

- Add "HTML Data Model Inspector" especially when work with card modals where dev tool could show the model data from card modal (suggestions?)
- **checkbox**
- label incorrect description
- missing text key description
- type should be "bfcheckbox1" or "checkbox" (all works)
- **checklist**
- listBox default is true
- **DateTime Picker**
- common configuration properties: missing "format" key, format of selected data in model
- dateTimePickerOptions "format" key, format of selected data showing in calendar
- **Image Display Element**
- suggest move the comments out from code snippet json; (copy paste json will gave user errors if comments in json)
- **Masked input**
- examples are broken (@Hassan Mukhtar do we even have a working example?)
- **Range Slider**
- examples are broken (@Hassan Mukhtar do we even have a working example?)
- Suggest: other than select and advanced Select, add "vueMultiSelect" mutiple dropdown and simple dropdown

**Grouping Elements**

- suggestion: instead of using bullet point with links, show the child pages in buttons like previous parent page "Common"
- **Tabs**: need more testing on this example
- **Accordion2**: also need double check the example {{row.*index +1}} not updating the row number*
- **listrows**: in example, dose not need schema and fields, just listrows object is enough

### **Actions Processor - Hassan**

- **Named Actions (Action Scripts)**
- Defining Named actions section is confusing and incorrect as we dont have a Misc tab to edit, its the scripts tab
- **Actions**
- We dont have an emit or consoleError actions in the snippets
- clear command doesnt mention BF.actionsClear() instead the vueapp clear

### **Script Hooks - Jason**

- **Global Variables**
- The Var Names $$BF_Model and $$BF_App in the chart are marked with astericks [] but no legend exists to indicate what the astericks indicate
- "Keys passed in will be merged with the current app model. (0.8.32+)" - Not clear what the number in bracket is supposed to represent
- "This data may not be present **of** reduced payload options are set for the current layout" - not clear what this means
- The first 3 have links and further information - but we are missing further info for the following:
- $$BF_User, $$BF_Query, $$BF_Cookie, $$BF_Form, $$BF_Payload
- **$$BF_Model** - Needs further information, e.g., JSONGetElement and JSONSetElement examples
- **$$BF_App** - Need emphasis about global vs local data and optimization use cases
- **$$BF_State** - Need use case for appSite to indicate dev vs. staging vs. production environments
- **Reducing Payload Size** - Needs reference pic for "Send full schema in utility hooks" setting + Model Override Method example
- **API Callback Endpoint** - Needs clearer examples for variables, headers/statusCode description, section reordering
- **Common Hooks** - Duplicate onLogin title, missing onAuthNotifier, Global Before/After, onApiCall sections
- **Scoped Hooks** - Missing section for onFormRequest

### **Users & Authentication - Jason**

- **Users & Authentication** - Need image for page editor authentication toggle + path action example
- **User Registration** - Need onRegistration hook details + BF_User to business file linking info
- **Managing User Accounts** - Methods section needs examples + Error Handling example
- **Custom Login Pages** - Navigation slugs link doesn't work properly
