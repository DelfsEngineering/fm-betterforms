# Components Editor

{% hint style="info" %}
If Alpha Features are enabled on your account, you will see the <mark style="color:orange;">`Component`</mark> tab in the right-hand navigation bar of the BF editor.
{% endhint %}

In this **Component Editor**, you can create and edit the components you want to insert into your pages.

* You can view your component at the top of the editor. By turning on the <mark style="color:red;">**`'Show Elements'`**</mark> option, you can view the structural elements of your component.
* You can write notes in the documentation and delete components from the **General** tab.
* You can edit your component's content in either the **Component Schema** tab using JSON, or in the **HTML** tab using the HTML editor.
* You can add mock data in the **Dev Data Model** tab.

**Note:** If you are using `model.somekey` data, the `model` refers to the page model that contains this component.
